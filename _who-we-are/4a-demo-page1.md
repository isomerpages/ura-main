Usher in a new decade with Singapore’s biggest countdown celebration at Marina Bay
Published: 04 November 2019

Celebrate in the city with a plethora of activities happening at Marina Bay and the Civic District as we get set to usher in the new year. Singapore’s biggest countdown event, Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2020, will light up the city skyline and bring people from all walks of life together to celebrate the occasion with an exciting line-up of events and experiences.

**Something for everyone on New Year’s Eve**

Presented by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), the Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2020 offers revellers a whole host of experiences for a great night out in the heart of our city. Extending from Marina Bay to the Civic District, the New Year’s Eve celebration will feature spectacular fireworks that can be viewed from around the bay, dazzling light projection displays, multi-sensory musical, riveting international circus acts, music performances, an array of family-friendly outdoor activities and more - there is something for everyone!

Coming to Singapore for the first time is The Great Circus of Europe presented by Uncle Ringo. On New Year’s Eve, the Bayfront Event Space will play host to a thrilling line-up of international circus acts where visitors can get up close to acrobats, gravity-defying motorbikes, contortionists, clowns and more. Visitors can also indulge in carnival games, thrill rides and delicacies at the food street.

STAR ISLAND SINGAPORE COUNTDOWN EDITION will return to The Float @ Marina Bay for its sophomore edition, whisking visitors off on an intergalactic adventure with a new theme – A Space Odyssey. The show will see Japanese fireworks, pyrotechnics, 3D surround sound and stage performances, all interfused into a single, seamless immersive experience.

Music lovers can look forward to Mediacorp’s Let’s Celebrate 2020 countdown concert at The Promontory that will bring the best of music, dance and fashion together, shining a spotlight on the top talents from Singapore. As we count down to new beginnings, come and enjoy live performances as our favourite artists reunite at Esplanade Presents: Come Together.

Visitors can also drop by Starlight @ The Lawn, an array of family-friendly and fun activities with bouncy castles, roving and stage performances, food and beverage options and more, presented by the Marina Bay Alliance1.

The streets at the Civic District will be closed once again to create a special car-free zone as an extension of the celebrations around the bay. Unwind @ Civic District will feature a variety of activities for visitors at the Empress Lawn and along Connaught Drive, allowing them to enjoy the night with their friends and loved ones while indulging in a wide variety of food and drinks.

**Light projections of hopes and dreams for Singapore**

In partnership with the National Volunteer & Philanthropy Centre and Giving.sg, Marina Bay Singapore Countdown 2020 will bring back the Build a Dream light projection shows featuring artworks by individuals from selected social service organisations, including SHINE Children and Youth Services, Beyond Social Services, Dyslexia Association of Singapore and Yishun Community Hospital. The illustrations, representing their hopes and dreams for Singapore, will transform the facades of The Fullerton Hotel Singapore, ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands and the Merlion with nightly light projections in the last week of December. The public can also do their part to support the social service organisations and their beneficiaries by donating or signing up as a volunteer via Giving.sg from 4 November to 31 January 2020.

Mr Lim Eng Hwee, Chief Executive Officer of the URA said, “More than just a celebration of the New Year, the Marina Bay Singapore Countdown this year also marks an exciting fresh beginning as we welcome a new decade. We hope the line-up of activities put together with the support of our partners and stakeholders will draw visitors, young and old, locals and tourists, to all come together and enjoy the New Year’s Eve at Marina Bay. As we welcome the New Year, we hope that the public will also help to play a part to support the social service organisations and their beneficiaries through the Build a Dream initiative.”
